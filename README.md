# Hostname Changer script

This script will change Ec2 instance hostname based on Tag:Name 

## How it works?
Easy, just ask Dave... it will check its own instance Tag:Name and if different to the current hostname it will perform some magic and that's it. 

## How to Install?

This script will be on an s3 yet to define and from there packer or whoever will copy from there.
